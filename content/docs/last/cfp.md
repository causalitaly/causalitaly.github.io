# Call for Papers

Causal-ITALY aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, logic, and philosophy of science,  with a dedicated focus on methods and trends emerging from the study of causality. 

This is in conjunction with the Italian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AIxIA. For details on conference partecipation, registration, venue, please visit [https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/](https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/) .

Submission deadline: 24th September 2021, Anywhere on Earth.

In a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence, causality stands out as a vastly important and needed feature. Causality directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for any ethical, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems.
Indeed, much of the current research in artificial intelligence aims at predicting future events.
However, no matter how sophisticated the predictive algorithms, their users may fall into the trap of equating correlation with causation. 

We welcome the submission of papers on systems, tools, and applications of artificial intelligence methods for causal learning and reasoning, both logic-based and statistical. We encourage submissions presenting recent developments, including works in progress, as well as short summaries of recently published papers. 

Papers will be collected in informal, non-archival proceedings.

## Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

* Causal discovery in complex environments and in real-world
* Efficient causal discovery in large-scale databases
* Causal effect identification and estimation
* Causally-enriched reinforcement learning and active learning
* Disentanglement, representation learning, and developing safe AI from a causal perspective	
* Modelling causal theories
* Causality, temporal reasoning and action theories
* Causality and counterfactual reasoning
* Causality, learning and experimental design
* Causality and probability
* Causality and equivalence
* Causality and ontology
* Relating non-monotonic approaches and Causal Networks
* Challenging problems and benchmark examples
* Tools, systems and applications dealing with causality

## Submission details
Kindly ensure that your paper is written in English and formatted using the guidelines you find [here](/formatting-guidelines.zip).

Long papers are limited to 7 pages including references. Short papers—including works in progress and summaries of recently published papers—are limited to 4 pages including references.

All papers must be submitted online via EasyChair submission portal of AIxIA conference [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aixia2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aixia2021) selecting "Workshop on Causality Causal-ITALY" as Track.

All submissions will be thoroughly peer-reviewed by experts based on originality, significance and clarity.

The informal, non-archival proceedings will be available at the workshop website.
