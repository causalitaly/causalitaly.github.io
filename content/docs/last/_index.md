# AIxIA Workshop on Causality (Causal-ITALY, 2nd Edition)

In a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence, causality stands out as a vastly important and needed feature. Causality directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for any ethical, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems.


This workshop will be part of the [21th International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://aixia2022.uniud.it/)
