# The First International AIxIA Workshop on Causality

In a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence, causality stands out as a vastly important and needed feature. Causality directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for any ethical, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems.


This workshop will take place on 30th November 2021, as part of the [20th International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/)
