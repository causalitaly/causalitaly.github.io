<p>Causal-ITALY aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, logic, and philosophy of science, with a dedicated focus on methods and trends emerging from the study of causality.</p>
<p>This is in conjunction with the Italian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AIxIA. For details on conference partecipation, registration, venue, please visit <a href=https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/>https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/</a> . We are currently envisaging a hybrid format: further details will be announced closer to the event.</p>
<p>Submission deadline: 24th September 2021, Anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>In a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence, causality stands out as a vastly important and needed feature. Causality directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for any ethical, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems.
Indeed, much of the current research in artificial intelligence aims at predicting future events.
However, no matter how sophisticated the predictive algorithms, their users may fall into the trap of equating correlation with causation.</p>
<p>We welcome the submission of papers on systems, tools, and applications of artificial intelligence methods for causal learning and reasoning, both logic-based and statistical. We encourage submissions presenting recent developments, including works in progress, as well as short summaries of recently published papers.</p>
<p>Papers will be collected in informal, non-archival proceedings.</p>

Submission details
<a class=anchor href=#submission-details>#</a>
</h2>
<p>Kindly ensure that your paper is written in English and formatted using the guidelines you find <a href=/formatting-guidelines.zip>here</a>.</p>
<p>Long papers are limited to 7 pages including references. Short papers—including works in progress and summaries of recently published papers—should be between 2 and 4 pages including references.</p>
<p>All papers must be submitted online via EasyChair submission portal of AIxIA conference <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aixia2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aixia2021</a> selecting &ldquo;Workshop on Causality Causal-ITALY&rdquo; as Track.</p>
<p>All submissions will be thoroughly peer-reviewed by experts based on originality, significance and clarity.</p>
<p>Causal-Italy is a specialized workshop without archival proceedings, and no proceedings available on the web. As such, many conferences accept duplicate submissions. We encourage the authors to carefully examine the policy of the conference/journal they intend to submit their work to before submitting their paper to Causal-Italy.</p>
