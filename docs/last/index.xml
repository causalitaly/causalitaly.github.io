This is in conjunction with the Italian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AIxIA. For details on conference participation, registration, venue, please visit https://aixia2021.disco.unimib.it/ . We are currently envisaging a virtual format: further details will be announced closer to the event.</description></item><item><title>Organisation</title><link>https://causalitaly.github.io/docs/last/pc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://causalitaly.github.io/docs/last/pc/</guid><description>Organisation # Chairs # Francesco Amigoni, PoliMI Federico Cerutti, UniBS Program Committee # Paolo Baldan, University of Padua, Italy Pietro Baroni, University of Brescia, Italy Marco Bernardo, University of Urbino, Italy Daniele Chiffi, Politecnico di Milano, Italy Luca Faes, University of Palermo, Italy Massimiliano Giacomin, University of Brescia, Italy Daniele Gorla, University La Sapienza, Italy Anthony Hunter, University College London, UK Claudio Mezzina, University of Urbino, Italy Paolo Milazzo, University of Pisa, Italy G.</description></item><item><title>Programme</title><link>https://causalitaly.github.io/docs/last/programme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://causalitaly.github.io/docs/last/programme/</guid><description>Keynotes # Sara Magliacane. Causality-inspired ML: what can causality do for ML? The domain adaptation case # Abstract:
Applying machine learning to real-world cases often requires methods that are trustworthy and robust w.r.t. heterogeneity, missing not at random or corrupt data, selection bias, non i.i.d. data etc. and that can generalize across different domains. Moreover, many tasks are inherently trying to answer causal questions and gather actionable insights, a task for which correlations are usually not enough.</description></item></channel></rss>
